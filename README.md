- Settings.ini holds user settings
- Settings form 
- Error Handling (most important ones)

- Newsfeed via server (HTML Page or plain txt file)
- Very simple update check 
- Auto close after login

- Devmode (Some admin features)
- Bugtracker inside Launcher to submit bugs to the Team with ease !
- Create Account from launcher
- Game Client Downloader with progressbar and download speed etc

INSTALLATION OF THE BACKEND AND SERVER SETUP:

- You will need a mangos server for either 2.4.3 or 3.3.5a .
- First upload the www folder contents to your WEBSERVER.
- Configure "www\wow\files\launcher\cfg.php" 
- Configure "www\wow\settings\cfg.php"
- Configure "\Launcher\Classes\classVars.cs" <- The links etc are located here
- If everything is set up correctly you can recompile the launcher and it should work.
